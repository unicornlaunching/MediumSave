## Why do Humans Execute Certain Actions?

Why do Humans Execute Certain Actions instead of Other Actions?

Why do Humans execute Certain Actions instead of Other Actions?

*Well, why do Organisms execute Certain Actions instead of Other Actions?*

**According to Boyd, Human Organisms act in order to ensure their own Survival. Ayn Rand would agree.**
>  An organism’s life depends on two factors: the material or fuel which it needs from the outside, from its physical background, and the action of its own body, the action of using that fuel properly? What standard determines what is proper in this context? The standard is the organism’s life, or: that which is required for the organism’s survival. — Ayn Rand

The nature of the Organism includes the way the Organism perpetuates its own survival. The nature of the Human, according to Boyd, yields the Goal, “Survive, survive on own terms, or improve our capacity for independent action.”
>  All Human Behavior is Belief-Driven. Beliefs are a Feeling of Certainty about what Something Means. — Tony Robbins
>  What are Human Beliefs based on? Our Belief Systems is built on Evolutionary Success. — Weinstein

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/382ac2bcca80b68556b0ae4d00388417" frameborder=0></iframe>
>  We tend to think of Intellect as having evolved because knowing what’s true gives you an advantage. But there’s nothing that says the Literal Truth is where Advantage Lies. — Bret Weinstein

Rothbard’s description of the Process of Human Action dovetails nicely with Rand and Boyd. For those of you in a Google Venture Design Sprint, this is the idea behind the idea of Making a Map.
>  Humans Act in order to attain Ends in some Future Period. Action is purposeful behavior directed toward the attainment of ends in some future period which will involve the fulfillment of wants otherwise remaining unsatisfied. The individual actor chooses to employ Elements in his Environment as means to the Expected Achievement of his Ends. His Method — his Chosen Means — may or may not turn out to be inappropriate. — [Rothbard](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Man,%20Economy,%20and%20State,%20with%20Power%20and%20Market_2.pdf)

Theory of Human Action by Rothbard

Rothbard — To sum up what we have learned thus far about human action:

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/8f5b0b9d7c7d9d3362970876842c1046" frameborder=0></iframe>
>  All human beings act by virtue of their existence and their nature as human beings. We could not conceive of human beings who do not act purposefully, who have no ends in view that they desire and attempt to attain. Things that did not act, that did not behave purposefully, would no longer be classified as human.- Rothbard
>  We should expect the belief systems that people hold to mirror the Evolutionary Interests that people have. — Bret Weinstein

### Thesis — Antithesis — Synthesis IN ACTION

## Competition for Scarce Resources In Emerging Markets

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/d95e635f372632ef4ed1332d41cec87f" frameborder=0></iframe>
>  My companies ranged from producing children educational media to developing Internet systems for companies to deliver online receipts, surveys and coupons to customers, which reduced tree usage and costs for customers. The conflict was primarily in competition with other companies operating in a free market — a game chosen by the players. Survival was dependent on innovation and providing a greener / low cost solution. The better the company did financially, the better the employees benefited. Service from the technologies included better education, lower cost, ease of use, improved customer communication and service. Everyone in this business ecosystem willingly participated in conflict, survival and conquest in service to others without actually hurting anyone. As for friends, I know people who revolutionized green buildings and solar solutions — all while in conflict with opposing forces, competition, survival of people in the companies and the ultimate conquest of an emerging market. — [Richard Merrick, Author of Interference, A Grand Scientific Musical Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Interference-Grand-Scientific-Musical-Theory/dp/0615205992/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=unicornlaunch-20&linkId=2bd0b453f4c6947bdf51a284396bdcb2&language=en_US)

## What is Good vs What is Bad?

It’s easy to get stuck on What is Good VS What is Bad.

The Difference between Truth vs. Fact vs. Wisdom is a major sticking point here.

### How Might We determine What is Good vs What is Bad?

## Origin of the North American Political, Legal, & Regulatory Environment
>  Beccaria had convinced the reasonable of the world of the inefficacy and the unrightfulness of the punishment of death. — Thomas Jefferson

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/ccf98afffb004c14bea8d403ba40cfbf" frameborder=0></iframe>

Toronto — and North American in general — derives its sense of What is Good and What is Bad from two key sources:

* The United States, whose Founding Fathers were heavily influenced by the writings of [Cesar Beccaria](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1408&context=public_law_and_legal_theory) (Schumpeter in fact called Beccaria “the Italian A. Smith,” and Adam Smith “the Scottish Beccaria.”)

* Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, whose writings are heavily intertwined with The Bible and the Torah
>  Broadly, speaking, Western society strives to find and prove “the truth”, while Eastern society accepts the truth as given and is more interested in finding the balance. Westerners put more stock in individual rights; Easterners in social responsibly.

## Law & Justice & The City-State via Plato

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/6134cd24ac19107dcb809fb1bdb48567" frameborder=0></iframe>
>  The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. — Whitehead

### In North America, the answer to the question “What is Good and What is Bad” has been largely determined by the notion of Justice. Our notion of Justice was heavily influenced by European Philosophical Thought.

In his dialogue Republic, Plato uses Socrates to argue for justice that covers both the just person and the just City State. Justice is a proper, harmonious relationship between the warring parts of the person or city. (Wikipedia)

![MacTutor History of Mathematics archive [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Plato_on_mathematics.html](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Plato_on_mathematics.html)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2696/1*6Fi6WyjWhC-50a3X3jBxSA.png)

## Canada VS US Political, Legal, & Regulatory Environments

The way the North American designed its Political, Legal & Regulatory Environment reflects Socrates argument that Justice covers both the just person and the just City State.
>  ‘Suppose the following to be the state of affairs on board ship or ships. The captain is larger and stronger than any of the crew, but a bit deaf and short-sighted, and similarly limited in seamanship. The crew are all quarreling about how to navigate the ship, each thinking he ought to be at the helm; they have never learned the art of navigation and cannot say that anyone ever taught it them, or that they spend any time studying it; indeed they say it can’t be taught and are ready to murder anyone who says it can. They spend all their time milling round the captain and doing all they can to get him to give them the helm. If one faction is more successful than another, their rivals may kill them and throw them overboard, lay out the honest captain with drugs or drink or in some other way, take control of the ship, help themselves to what’s on board, and turn the voyage into the sort of drunken pleasure-cruise you would expect. Finally, they reserve their admiration for the man who knows how to lend a hand in 
controlling the captain by force or fraud; they praise his seamanship and navigation and knowledge of the sea and condemn everyone else as useless. They have no idea that the true navigator must study the seasons of the year, the sky, the stars, the winds and all the other subjects appropriate to his profession if he is to be really fit to control a ship; and they think that it’s quite impossible to acquire the professional skill needed for such control (whether or not they want it exercised) and that there’s no such thing as an art of navigation. With all this going on aboard aren’t the sailors on any such ship bound to regard the true navigator as a word-spinner and a star-gazer, of no use to them at all?’ — Socrates

The US determines what is Good and What is Bad in a fundamentally different way than Canadians determine what is Good and What is Bad:

* In the US, What is Good is is that which promotes Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.

* In Canada, what is Good is that which promotes Peace Order & Good Government.

On face value, they sound the same. However, when you begin to weigh the Individual’s Right to Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness with the Group’s Right to Peace Order & Good Government, violent disagreements ensue.

The Rights of the Individual Human Being can sometimes be at odds with the Rights of the Group of Human Beings.

The US differs from Canada in the way they their laws and The Political, Legal & Regulatory Environment at large balance:

* The Rights of Individual Human Beings

* VS

* The Rights of Groups of Human Beings

### United States: Life Liberty & The Pursuit of Happiness

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/188cffb1485aa438894bb5ea9083dd18" frameborder=0></iframe>

Life Liberty & The Pursuit of Happiness gives three examples of the “unalienable rights” which the Declaration says have been given to all human beings by their creator, and which governments are created to protect. (Wikipedia)

### Canada: Peace Order & Good Government

The now familiar phrase “peace, order and good government” was originally used in the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867) enacted by the Imperial Parliament, and it defines the principles under which the Canadian Parliament should legislate. (Wikipedia)

Can you see how the United States enshrines the Individual’s Rights whereas Canada enshrines the Group’s Rights?

### Case Study: Hate Speech — Individual vs. Group Rights

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/17a237bea4454944cfc98f804d5c54be" frameborder=0></iframe>

The Rights of the Individual vs. The Rights of the Group are the basis for the most emotionally-charged Political Debates on the continent.

**We now have a basis for determining Good and Bad.**

While it can be Good to ensure the Individual is afforded Life LIberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, it is also Good to ensure Peace and Order at the level of Groups of Individuals aka Society. How we balance the interest of the Individual vs the interest of Society is what Judges are in charge of.

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/659cfcf8871e3d16cde488e493c4e53a" frameborder=0></iframe>

What is the balance between:

* Alex Jones’ right to Freedom Of Speech

* Sandy Hook victims right to Peace & Order

**We now have a basis for disagreeing on Good and Bad.**

It’s the reason that Hate Speech is at the center of many Legal Disagreements In North America. We want to balance the Individual’s Right to Speak AND balance a Group’s right not to have an Individual’s Speech result in the murder of one of it’s members. Where does Hate Speech go from Allowable Speech to Unallowable?

## How Do We Fundamentally Decide if a Human’s Actions are Good or Bad?

Practically-speaking, a Country establishes Written Laws to help its Citizens distinguish between Good Actions vs Bad Actions and shape the Behavior of its Citizens.

But what makes an Individual Human Action Good? What makes an Individual Action Bad?
>  “There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or nonexistence — and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil.” — Rand

And what about on a Group level? What makes a Group’s Action Good and a Group’s Action Bad? Rand’s connection between Life and Value makes sense here, too.

### Case Study — US Foreign Policy — A Yin-Yang By Any Other Name

Some say the US conquered the world in DEFENSE after securing victories in WWI and WWII. Did the US Execute a Good Action or a Bad Action in entering WWI and/or WWII?

In the end, we’re all likely to be Haters. If you’re from the US, you’ll think the atomic bombing of Hiroshima was a Good Action. If you’re from Japan, you’ll think the atomic bombing of Hiroshima was a Bad Action. In the end, we’re all likely to judge Good Actions vs. Bad Actions based on whether our own survival was helped or hurt in the process.

People on the Wrong (Losing) Side of History are punished by People on the Right (Winning) Side of History. That’s not to say Humans Executing Good Actions are necessarily on The Good Side of History and Humans Executing Bad Actions are necessarily on The Bad Side of History.

In defense of the US, you can’t deny that Africa and India and Mainland China are going to benefit from the Technology Experiment conducted on the Sociocultural Environment in the US.

Genghis Khan’s genocides helped pave the Silk Road that fed many starving Merchant families. Were the Khan’s murders Good Actions or Bad Actions?

## **Again, that’s easy. We judge Good or Bad based on whether an Action helped our survival (Good Action) or hurt our survival (Bad Action. We’re all susceptible to this bias.**

### Case Study — An Inconvenient Hypocrisy

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/cd2a9260beca4b6098866e8a35492dc6" frameborder=0></iframe>

Al Gore — on the noble purpose of Executing Good Actions on behalf of the Planet Earth — visited India. He tried to tell India that they shouldn’t use coal-based energy because Humanity’s Survival was the Supreme Good. India their use of coal-based Energy based on the fact that the US fed and grew it’s Citizen Organism Population for 150 years using coal-based Energy.
>  “The base load in India is coal. It cannot be anything else as we don’t have gas and without a base load we can’t even do renewable energy. We are a developing nation. We are rapidly creating infrastructure, setting up manufacturing, creating jobs for our people, setting up homes, all of which the United States and the European nations did in the last 150 years on the back of low carbon base or coal-based energy,” Piyush Goyal, minister of state for coal, mines, power and new & renewable energy had said during the 2015 Paris summit.

Clearly, the challenge of determining Good and Bad is determining what Actions lead to Survival and which Actions lead to Death.
>  An organism’s life depends on two factors: the material or fuel which it needs from the outside, from its physical background, and the action of its own body, the action of using that fuel properly? What standard determines what is proper in this context? The standard is the organism’s life, or: that which is required for the organism’s survival. — Rand
>  No choice is open to an organism in this issue: that which is required for its survival is determine by its nature, by the kind of entity it is. — Rand
>  Life can be kept in existence only by a constant process of self-sustaining action. The goal of that action, the ultimate value which, to be kept, must be gained through its every moment, is the organism’s life. An organism’s life is its standard of value: that which furthers its life is the good, that which threatens it is the evil. — Rand

## Prototyping Profitable City-States — The Path To An Excellent World — Shenzhen

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/f2e002ae93f6a2f749c23d8274923d7a" frameborder=0></iframe>

Like Bret Weinstein suggests, prototyping change on a small scale can teach a large Country a lot AND make them a ton of money in the process. Shenzhen — China’s Pearl of Economic Activity and the place where 80% of the world’s electronics are manufactured — is a Political Legal & Regulatory Experiment that pairs Economic Freedom with Technological Freedom and Pure Competition in a tightly Geographically-defined space 90 minutes from Hong Kong, bustling night and day with 20% of the Entire Country’s PhD’s just 90 minutes away from Hong Kong’s aquarium of Savvy Venture Capitalists.

As always, Shakespeare addresses this Good Action vs. Bad Action argument well.
>  …for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Hamlet, Shakespeare

So we see that What is Good vs. What is Bad is a Subjective Judgment that depends on the Human Being instincts towards his survival.

## Politics & Show Business

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/6b4630c37e2af3cd0157093d2f148561" frameborder=0></iframe>

Politics is not about What is Good & What is Bad as much as it could be. Why? Television is a Medium of Entertainment, not a Medium of Information. Television pays for itself with Advertisers. Advertisers have to Entertain in order to sell. Advertisers make decisions that ensure their Survival. Advertisers therefore may not share the same conception of Good & Bad as you do.

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/9f2e7db86638f5217374584c519e33bf" frameborder=0></iframe>

Since the Medium is the Message (McCluhan), and the Television is the primary way Voters select who to Vote for, Political Leaders have had to become more and more entertaining in order to attract votes from their competition. It would appear that Being Good is not Good Enough to get Noticed aka Pass The Just Noticeable Difference.

## Do We Need Laws To Govern Human Activity? (Bible)

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/eee12482f40588e3819a651829f0f80e" frameborder=0></iframe>

Given that Humans are Action-Oriented Individuals — and Good and Bad Actions are unfortunately determined by what will ensure the Survival of the Human making the decision and therefore might be harmfully selfish — do Humans need Laws in order to Live Long & Prosper? The Bible thinks so.
>  The only proper, moral purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, which means: to protect him from physical violence — to protect his right to his own life, to his own liberty, to his own property and to the pursuit of his own happiness. Without property rights, no other rights are possible. — Rand

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/396d1dee6a085cd740ba25e257309a81" frameborder=0></iframe>

In fact, the first book of The Bible/Torah — Genesis/Bereishit — describes a world without Written Law. In Genesis, Humans don’t live long and prosper without Written Law. Things go so badly On Earth without Written Law that God scraps His Prototype with a Flood and starts again. As it turns out, the Human Being-dominated world operating WITHOUT Written Law can be a scary place filled with death and destruction of Individual Human Beings and Human Cities.

In the second book of The Bible — Exodus — Written Law is introduced to Human Beings in the form of the Ten Commandments. with the Introduction of Written Law, humans live longer and experience more prosperity at the Individual and Group Level. At the very least, God doesn’t scrap the prototype a second time.

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/30ad9f5730f11e1673fb10273c7afbb7" frameborder=0></iframe>
>  Can man derive any personal benefit from living in a human society? Yes — if it is a human society. The two great values to be gained from social existence are: knowledge & trade. — Rand
>  The principle of trade is the only rational ethical principle for all human relationships, personal land social, private and public, spiritual and material. It is the principle of justice. — Rand
>  Man is the only species that can transmit and expand his store of knowledge from generation to generation; the knowledge potentially available to man is greater than any one man could begin to acquire in his own lifespan; every man gains an incalculable benefit from the knowledge discovered by others. — Rand

At A Societal Level, the West has instituted a Political Legal & Regulatory system has attempted to balance the:

* The Fight to Preserve Individual Life Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness

* VS

* The Fight to Promote Peace Order & Good Government.
>  Even Tyrants know that Societies need Law in order to operate. — Alan Dershowitz

* Synectics is the process of explaining a Foreign Concept using Concepts that are Familiar to the Audience. Why is this important?

* Audiences are mostly likely to share Concepts with Similar Audiences according to race, ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic status. (Everett)

* The Bible is a Product whose intention is to spread to as many Human Beings as Possible. Therefore, to ensure that it spreads to as many Human Beings as possible, it must employ Communication Strategies & Tactics that make the knowledgeable Spreadable, to so speak.

* Homophily refers to the tendency for people to have (non-negative) ties with people who are similar to themselves in socially significant ways. Studies of homophily have linked attraction between individuals based on similarly shared demographics. These may include, but are not limited to: race, ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic status.

**[1:2]**

**B: the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.**

**T: Now the earth was astonishingly empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water.**

* The Elements: Wind, Water

**[1:3]**

**B: And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.**

**T: Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.**

* The Element: Light

**[1:4]**

**B: And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.**

**T: And God saw the light that it was good, and God separated between the light and between the darkness.**

* The Light is ‘good’ — whatever that means.

**[1:5]**

**B: God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.**

**T: And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night, and it was evening and it was morning, one day.**

* Can’t forget about the concept of Time.

**[1:6]**

**T: And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water.”**

**B: And God said, “Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”**

* Figure & Ground

**[1:7]**

**T: And God made the expanse and it separated between the water that was below the expanse and the water that was above the expanse, and it was so.**

**B: So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so.**

* Figure & Ground

**[1:8]**

**T: And God called the expanse Heaven, and it was evening, and it was morning, a second day.**

**B: God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.**

* Separating Morning Time from Evening Time. Separating Individual Pairs of Morning Time and Evening Time into Days.

**[1:9]**

**T: And God said, “Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear,” and it was so.**

**B: And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.**

* Element: Earth aka Dry Land

**[1:10]**

**B: God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.**

**T: And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas, and God saw that it was good.**

* Elements: Dry Land is called Earth and Waters are called Seas. Again, the notion of Good appears.

### The FIRST value judgment made in both the Torah and The Bible is that the Light was Good.

That bears repeating. Before God creates Light, nothing is inherently good or bad. The Light is the first instance of something in Creation having ‘Good’-ness. I cannot overstate the importance of separating Truth & Knowledge & Fact from the Good.

That’s why Socrates explains what is Good using three analogies:

* The Sun Analogy

* The Allegory of the Cave

* The Analogy of the Divided Line

What did Plato mean that we could understand The Pure Ideas or the Pure Forms through the Divided Line is a reference to Euclid.

### The Bible and The Torah’s assertion of the GOOD is reflected in Socrates’ Analogy of the Sun.

### Or is Socrates’ Analogy of the Sun representing the nature of What is Good reflected in The Bible’s Analogy of the Sun representing the nature of What is Good?

### Or are both assertions of the Good based on the Torah and Early Jewish Mysticism which enshrined the Ideal Human as follows:

## Who Determines a Country’s Law?

Interestingly enough, a Country’s Laws are not derived by the Country’s Citizens, per se.

A Country’s Laws are determined by the Citizens living in the Country’s Most Strategic MegaCities where Strategy = Proximity to Water.

Why? The MegaCities that are Strategically located in close Proximity to Water are able to trade knowledge, goods, and services faster than every other MegaCity in the country. That makes them the Socio-Economic SuperPower of the Country. Sometimes SuperPowers are prone to becoming bullies. Power has that effect on Supers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ba0sgfJ9dv_2ySoDupMfdw.png)

For example, the Laws which Rule over the United States are determined by Decisions made in the MegaCities of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago Florida. As you can see, the US determines the influence of a MegaCity based on Proximity to Water. Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and Ottawa all lie on strategic Proximities to Water.

Ditto for Canada. The Laws which Rule over Canada are determined by Decisions made in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and Ottawa. Ditto for England. The Laws which rule over England are determined by Decisions made in the MegaCity of London. Ditto? Ditto!!

In other words, for better or for worse, MegaCities determine the Laws which Rule over the Countries in which they inhabit. Since Laws are determined by the Political, Legal, and Regulatory Environment in a City, that’s why people in the ‘country-side’ typically feel left out.

This is a crucial distinction because there is often a disagreement which is more important:

* The Fight to Preserve Individual Life Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness

* vs

* The Fight to Promote Peace Order & Good Government.

## How Did The Greeks Steer their Megacities?

Socrates Parable of the Ship | Entrust Expert Navigators To Steer The Ship
>  One should trust one’s city to an expert in the subject of the good, not to a mere politician who tries to gain power by giving people what they want, rather than what’s good for them. Socrates uses the parable of the ship to illustrate this point: the unjust city is like a ship in open ocean, crewed by a powerful but drunken captain (the common people), a group of untrustworthy advisors who try to manipulate the captain into giving them power over the ship’s course (the politicians), and a navigator (the philosopher) who is the only one who knows how to get the ship to port. For Socrates, the only way the ship will reach its destination — the good — is if the navigator takes charge. ~ Socrates (Wikipedia) (Excerpted from Plato, The Republic, Book 6, lines 487d-488e, translated by Desmond Lee [New York: Penguin, 2003 [1955])

Greek Philosophy insisted that there was a Good that existed separate from Truth & Knowledge.
>  There are many beautiful things and many good things. — Socrates
>  There is one Form that underlies the Form of the Beautiful and the Form of the Good.

## How do Human Beings fundamentally Observe Reality?

* Seeing with our Eyes

* Hearing with our Ears

* Touching with our Bodies

* Tasting with our Tongues

* Smelling with our Nose

**Plato regarded the sense of Sight as special. Why?**

Sight — our ability to See Objects with our Eyes — occurs because there is Light that shines upon an Object. If organisms fundamentally act in order to ensure their own survival (Growth & Nourishment), then they act in relation to Light, namely, Sun Light).
>  For things in the physical world, the Sun is both the Cause of their Growth and Nourishment and the Cause of their Very Existence; likewise, the good is responsible for objects of knowledge being known and the existence of objects of knowledge, i.e. Forms, in the first place (509c) — Plato
>  The Sun is both the cause of the Earth’s Growth and Nourishment. The Good is the cause of the Earth’s Knowledge and the Existence of the Objects of Knowledge itself. — Plato’s Timaeus
>  And God saw that the light was good. — Genesis

## The Critical Distinction between Eastern & Western Philosophical Thought

Is there a role for not-good to play in the proliferation of the Good? Now you can see clearly the difference between Western Philosophical Thought and Eastern Philosophical Thought.

Broadly, speaking, Western society strives to find and prove “the truth”, while Eastern society accepts the truth as given and is more interested in finding the balance. Westerners put more stock in individual rights; Easterners in social responsibly. — [You’re Inspirational E-Coach](http://www.1000ventures.com/index.html)

Striving Towards The Good — in the Platonic Form Sense — Can Be Scientifically Good

## Are the solutions to life’s problems at the root of the Platonic Forms?
>  Let us now assign the geometrical forms to their respective elements. The cube is the most stable of them because resting on a quadrangular plane surface, and composed of isosceles triangles. To the earth then, which is the most stable of bodies and the most easily modelled of them, may be assigned the form of a cube; and the remaining forms to the other elements, — to fire the pyramid, to air the octahedron, and to water the icosahedron, — according to their degrees of lightness or heaviness or power, or want of power, of penetration. The single particles of any of the elements are not seen by reason of their smallness; they only become visible when collected. The ratios of their motions, numbers, and other properties, are ordered by the God, who harmonized them as far as necessity permitted. — Plato, Timaeus

## Properly Defining Capitalism (Excerpt from [A Future of Peace and Capitalism](https://mises.org/library/future-peace-and-capitalism))

In Marxian political economy, capital is money used to buy something only in order to sell it again to realize a financial profit.

### Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels used the term capitalist (Kapitalist) in The Communist Manifesto (1848) to refer to a private owner of capital.

In order to discuss the “future of capitalism,” we must first decide what the meaning of the term “capitalism” really is. Unfortunately, the term “capitalism” was coined by its greatest and most famous enemy, Karl Marx. I consider anarcho-capitalists to have exposited the most accurate definition for this term. This definition generally holds that state-based capitalism does not constitute capitalism at all. Murray Rothbard, arguably the most famous anarchocapitalist to date, explains,
>  In order to discuss the “future of capitalism,” we must first decide what the meaning of the term “capitalism” really is. Unfortunately, the term “capitalism” was coined by its greatest and most famous enemy, Karl Marx. We really can’t rely upon him for correct and subtle usage. And, in fact, what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call “free-market capitalism” on the one hand, and “state capitalism” on the other. — [Man Economy & State](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Man,%20Economy,%20and%20State,%20with%20Power%20and%20Market_2.pdf)

Rothbard casts the difference between state-based capitalism and pure capitalism as the difference “between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation.”61 Any government intervention — either the “prohibiting or partially prohibiting [of] an exchange between people”62 — removes an exchange from the realm of capitalism and into the realm of government. State-based capitalism is not capitalism. Capitalism is, in short, a system of voluntary economic exchanges between parties without government interest or intervention. In a capitalist system, resolving disputes that arise from such exchanges is left to non-governmental institutions.63

## CONCLUSION

Why Do Humans Execute Actions ≠ How Humans Execute Actions ≠ How Might Humans Execute Actions ≠ The Reasons Humans Attribute Good & Bad To Their Actions and the Actions of Others

You might be convinced that knowing everything that is can help humans to determine how to act or how to be.

The is–ought problem, as articulated by the Scottish philosopher and historian David Hume (1711–76), states that many writers make claims about what ought to be, based on statements about what is.

That said, Knowing ‘As Is’ is the first step to moving towards a ‘To Be’. You cannot get from Spain to The India without knowing that you’re starting in Spain. Oops — wrong — Columbus didn’t discover India. He discovered the Caribbean and then America, a Geography that the Spanish and English could exploit. Or can you? That’s where Bret Weinstein’s Societal Prototyping Idea comes in. Luckily, China’s already proved that it can work with their Shenzhen Experiment.

Therefore, Knowing Humans “As Is” is the most important step to determining “How Humans Ought To Be”.
>  Can man derive any personal benefit from living in a human society? Yes — if it is a human society. The two great values to be gained from social existence are: knowledge & trade. — Rand

Before Socrates, there was Empedocles

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/ed792bb96813ab512a5b6bd7743634bc" frameborder=0></iframe>

Now you know where Socrates got his idea of the Good. Now you know why The Sun Analogy — and Light itself — was though to be something worth building a society around.

The Good is to be found in the Four Elements and Understanding of the forces of Love (Attraction) and Strife (Repulsion). Both Love & strife — a la Thesis Antithesis Synthesis — are creative forces that act on the four elements — Air, Water, Fire, and Earth.

As Professor Richardson & Empedocles asserts, everyone always forgets about Geography aka The Earth and Strife aka Competition (Love & Strife aka Symbiosis).
